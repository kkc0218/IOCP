# ============================================================================
# NOTES:
# ============================================================================

# 1. The server supports multiple concurrent clients
# 2. Writes to different sections can happen simultaneously
# 3. Writes to the same section are queued and processed in order
# 4. Shorter writes (fewer lines) are prioritized over longer writes
# 5. All operations are thread-safe and lock-free where possible
# 6. The server maintains document state until shutdown
# 7. Error handling is comprehensive and user-friendly

# Performance Characteristics:
# - Supports 1000+ concurrent connections
# - Sub-millisecond response times for read operations
# - Efficient memory usage with pre-allocated buffers
# - Scales linearly with CPU core count
